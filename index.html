          <li>After my previous job I left to pursue a degree in Business Finance from the University of Missouri Kansas
            City. Then COVID-19 happened and derailed those plans. I got a job at FedEx loading their trucks and since I
            left in October of 2020 I have been in and out of school trying to get a start on a new profession. I moved
            to Minneapolis in November after a friend of mine told me about the Prime Academy. I am hoping to start a
            career in Web Development after graduation and begin a new career I can be happy with.</li>
